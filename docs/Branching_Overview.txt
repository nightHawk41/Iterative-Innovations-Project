ITERATIVE INNOVATIONS: HOW OUR BRANCHING WORKS
============================================================

1. THE "MAIN" BRANCH (The Production Line)
Think of the 'main' branch as our "Final Product." It should 
ALWAYS be stable and bug-free. We never code directly here 
because if we break 'main', the whole team is stuck.

2. FEATURE BRANCHES (Your Private Workspace)
When you start a task, you create a "Feature Branch." This 
is like a parallel universe. You can experiment, break things, 
and rewrite code without affecting anyone else. 

   Main Branch:   -------------------------------------> (Stable)
                        \                        /
   Your Branch:          \-- [Your Work] --/ (Testing)

3. THE "PULL REQUEST" (The Quality Gate)
When your work is done, you ask to "Merge" your branch back 
into 'main'. This is called a Pull Request (PR). 
- It allows a teammate to look at your code.
- It ensures we don't accidentally delete someone else's work.
- It keeps our "Final Product" clean and professional.

4. WHY WE DO THIS:
- Safety: You can't accidentally delete the whole project.
- Collaboration: Two people can work on different features 
  at the same time without their code clashing.
- Accountability: We can see exactly who made which changes 
  and why (essential for our grade!).

5. THE GOLDEN RULE:
"Code on your branch, Review on the PR, Merge to Main."
