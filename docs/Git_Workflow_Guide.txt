ITERATIVE INNOVATIONS: GIT WORKFLOW GUIDE
============================================================

To keep our project clean and ensure we get full credit for 
our engineering process, please follow these steps for 
EVERY task/ticket.

STEP 1: GET THE LATEST CODE
Before starting, make sure your local 'main' is up to date.
  1. git checkout main
  2. git pull origin main

STEP 2: CREATE A FEATURE BRANCH
Never code directly on main. Create a branch for your task.
Naming convention: feature/name-of-task
  1. git checkout -b feature/your-task-name

STEP 3: CODE AND COMMIT
Work on your files in VS Code. Once ready:
  1. git add .
  2. git commit -m "Brief description of what you did"

STEP 4: PUSH TO GITHUB
Upload your branch so the team can see it.
  1. git push origin feature/your-task-name

STEP 5: CREATE A PULL REQUEST (PR)
You cannot merge your own code to main; it needs a review!
  1. Go to our GitHub Repository in your browser.
  2. Click the yellow "Compare & pull request" button.
  3. Add a description of your changes.
  4. Assign one teammate as a "Reviewer."
  5. Click "Create pull request."

STEP 6: REVIEWING A TEAMMATE
If you are asked to review:
  1. Go to the "Pull Requests" tab.
  2. Click "Files changed" to see the code.
  3. If it looks good, click "Review changes" -> "Approve".

STEP 7: CLEAN UP
Once the PR is merged on GitHub:
  1. git checkout main
  2. git pull origin main
  3. git branch -d feature/your-task-name (This deletes your local branch)
